# xayn_front_office_sdk

Front Office API
- API version: 1.0.0-rc6
  - Build date: 2022-12-22T15:59:27.783084Z[Etc/UTC]

# Front Office
The front office is typically used within front-end apps, for example a website or a mobile application.
With this SDK, you can handle interactions with documents and request a list of personalized documents.

## User
Each method requires a `user_id`.
From our perspective, a `user_id` is simply required to group interactions together. We don't need to know who that user is, so it is preferred to create this `user_id` in a privacy-preserving way.
For example, create a hash method which transforms your user into an ID hash.

## Document
A document here is represented by its `id` and optional `properties`.
In order to display a document in an interface, it's preferred to use `properties`, which is an arbitrary collection of values.
For example, it could contain an image url, a full article url, the publication date, the author or much more.
The properties that were added when the document was submitted to us, are just mirrored here.

## Auth
The API requires an authenticationToken when used.
Please see further down in this README.md file, or refer to the test included in this SDK's codebase, on how to set this token correctly.
